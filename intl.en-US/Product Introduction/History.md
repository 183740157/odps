# History {#concept_wlg_dwv_tdb .concept}

When Alibaba Cloud was founded in September 2009, our vision was to be the first platform for data processing and sharing. In April 2010, that vision came a little closer to reality with the Open Data Processing Service \(ODPS\) supporting the newly launched loan business area of Ant Financial. From there, things went from strength to strength. In 2012, a Unified Data Platform was established. By the end of 2013, we had the ability to process massive volumes of data on a large scale. From 2014 to 2015, the big data platform was refined, and in 2016, MaxCompute 2.0 was born, providing massive data warehousing solutions and big data modeling capabilities.
