# Service pricing {#concept_vsd_d5t_z2b .concept}

This article introduces you to an overview of the MaxCompute Lightning service charges.

**Note:** 

-   The MaxCompute Lightning service is currently in the beta phase and is available for free.
-   The service will incur fees \(the actual unit price is yet to be determined\) after the beta ends, and you will only pay for the data amount scanned by each query.

You only pay for queries you run when using MaxCompute Lightning. Billing is based on MaxCompute project table data amount scanned by queries. You will not incur any fees when no queries are performed.

MaxCompute Lightning is dependent on the MaxCompute projects you created. Therefore, you need to pay attention to the costs incurred by MaxCompute data storage, computation \(pay-as-you-go or subscription based on CU costs\), and external network downloads.
