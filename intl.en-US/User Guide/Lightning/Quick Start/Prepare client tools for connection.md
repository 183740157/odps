# Prepare client tools for connection {#concept_tyy_jwt_z2b .concept}

MaxCompute Lightning is compatible with PostgreSQL interfaces and is accessible to client tools that are connected to PostgreSQL databases.

[Tableau Desktop](https://www.tableau.com/products/desktop) BI tools are used in this tutorial. Download related tools from the Tableau official website.

Other commonly used client tools, such as SQL Workbench/J, PSQL, FineReport BI, and MicroStrategy BI tools, can be connected to MaxCompute Lightning in the same way as to PostgreSQL databases.
