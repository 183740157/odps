Using MaxCompute Lightning requires that MaxCompute has been activated and a project has been created.

If you have not activated MaxCompute, activate the service first. For more information, see [Activate MaxCompute](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/58226.htm). Then, create a MaxCompute project.

## Create a table and import data {#section_dpx_2mj_z2b .section}

Tables have been created in the project and data has been loaded. For more information, see [MaxCompute Quick Start](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/27808.htm).

## Obtain account information {#section_gbz_ymj_z2b .section}

The access ID and access key for the MaxCompute project have been obtained.

You can log on to the Alibaba Cloud website, and click Console to view the AccessKey page. Contact the owner of the primary account if your RAM user is not granted permission to view AccessKey. You also need to ensure your RAM user is granted permission to view project tables.
